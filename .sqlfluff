# Excluded rules:
# RF02 - "Inconsistent capitalisation of keywords"
#        This rule checks whether SQL keywords are consistently capitalized.
#        By excluding it, SQLFluff will not complain if keywords are not consistently upper-case.
#
# RF04 - "Keywords should not be used as identifiers"
#        This rule flags column names or aliases that are SQL reserved keywords.
#        By excluding it, SQLFluff will not warn if you have columns like 'comment' or 'volume'.
